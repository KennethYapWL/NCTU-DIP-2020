# NCTU Image Processing 2020
This class is teached by Prof Tsaipei Wang.
Three assignments, two exams, and a final presentation have been done during all the classes.

Here are some information about the assigments and final presentation.
## 1. Final Presentation.
Classmate will needed to grouped and present a topic that is not discussed during the class.
My group has been assigned the topic about image watermarking, the folder "Final Presentation" contains the presentation pptx file and a final report.

## 2. First Assignment.
This assignment is about doing experiments on provided 6 images with image enhancement techniques, such as smoothing, sharpening, contrast adjustment, etc.
No packages is allowed in this assignment, and I choose Matlab as the programming language to do implementation.
The report of the assignment 1 is included.

## 3. Second Assignment.
This assignment asks us to implement several image segmentation techniques, and do some experiments on the four of six images provided in the first assignment.
We also have to implement one of the edge detection techniques from Canny Edge Detection, Hough Transform, or Watershed Algorithm.
I have done this assignemnt with Matlab and succeed to implement the Canny Edge Detection, while Watershed Algorithm isn't completed yet due to the time issue.

## 4. Third Assignemnt.
This assignment is about implementation of image compression. We are asked to implement a basic encoder-decoder style JPEG codec, with included various components, such as Block based DCT, Quantization, Predictive Coding (Delta Coding is used in my implementation), Run-Length Coding, Chromatic Subsampling, and Huffman Coding.
I think it is much easier to done the implementation by using Python, so different from previous assignment, this assignemnt will be done with Python.
The references you have read is the keypoint to make this success, dont try to start doing this assignment when its near to the deadline within one week. There are still limited resources you could find to complete this assignment.
The useful articles are provided in the report in this folder. Key Point: the concept of JPEG components, JFIF format, how to store the components in JFIF format to the JPEG file.


Note: If I am not lazy enough, I probably will try to implement these assignemnts with different program languages.LOL
