# NCTU Image Processing 2020
This class is taught by Prof Tsaipei Wang.
Three assignments, two exams, and a final presentation are needed to be done during all the classes.

Here is some information about these assignments and the final 
## 1. Final Presentation.
Classmates will be needed to group and make a presentation for a topic that is not discussed during the class.
My group was assigned the topic of image watermarking, the folder "Final Presentation" contains the presentation ppt file, and a final report.

## 2. First Assignment.
This assignment is about doing experiments on provided 6 images with image enhancement techniques, such as smoothing, sharpening, contrast adjustment, etc.
No packages are allowed in this assignment, and I choose Matlab as the programming language to do the implementation.
The report of assignment 1 is included.

## 3. Second Assignment.
This assignment asks us to implement several image segmentation techniques, and do some experiments on the four of six images provided in the first assignment.
We also have to implement one of the edge detection techniques from Canny Edge Detection, Hough Transform, or Watershed Algorithm.
I have done this assignment with Matlab and succeed to implement the Canny Edge Detection, while Watershed Algorithm isn't completed yet due to the time issue.

## 4. Third Assignemnt.
This assignment is about the implementation of image compression. We are asked to implement a basic encoder-decoder style JPEG codec, with included various components, such as Block based DCT, Quantization, Predictive Coding (Delta Coding is used in my implementation), Run-Length Coding, Chromatic Subsampling, and Huffman Coding.
I think it is much easier to do the implementation by using Python, so different from a previous assignment, this assignment will be done with Python.
The references you have read is the key point to make this success, don't try to start doing this assignment when it is already one week left from the deadline. There are still only limited resources you could find to complete this assignment.
The useful articles are provided in the report in this folder. Key Point: the concept of JPEG components, JFIF format, how to store the components in JFIF format to the JPEG file.
